# Welcome to the Helix user documentation

**Helix** lets you can **rapidly** develop machine learning models of many kinds, and evaluate their performance down to a **feature-by-feature** level.

You can create models to solve either **classification** problems (e.g. is this image a cat 🐱 or a dog 🐶?)
or **regression** problems (e.g. what will be the price of gold 🏅 tomorrow 📈?).

Your models can then be evaluated by general measures, such as **accuracy**, and by individual feature metrics,
such as **SHAP**.
